Proposed changes:
  1. gdb terminal/buffer name is the same of the gdb program used (e.g. gdb,
     arm-none-eabi-gdb, mygdb, etc) => Already implemented.
  2. Added <Plug> for allowing mappings, I don't like that map_key thing that
     is inplace now.
  3. Add save win view at the beginning so user can restore view if he mess up
     with the windows
  4. Consider an Init() function to initialize the script-local variables so
     every time :Termdebug is invoked all the script variables are cleaned
  4. Select which windows to show and adjust their layout
  5. Set "unlisted" the buffers that you don't actually need (like the
     communication buffer)
  6. Address some Issues like #14187,
  7. IsGdbRunning() should return a bool rather than a string
  8. I don't really like the double config with the dict g:termdebug_config
     and single variables e.g. g:termdebugger
  9. Adjust the prompt/terminal selection. Use 'terminal' by default and state
     in the docs that if things don't work to use 'prompt'
 10. Switch between 'embedded' or 'desktop'
 11. CommOut/DecodeMessage could be improved... see #10300 and comments in source code.
 12. Change if exists(':Termdebug') with if exists('g:termdebug_loaded')

Notes:
  1. There are many 'any' type hints because I don't know what to put there.
  2. In the original script there were a number of unlet and I wrote some
     proposals on how to deal with them
  3.  Do we still need the following in Vim9?
      var save_cpo = &cpo
      set cpo&vim
  4. Different notes are searchable with /UBA.
