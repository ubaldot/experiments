Feature changes:
  1. gdb terminal/buffer name is the same of the gdb program used (e.g. gdb,
     arm-none-eabi-gdb, mygdb, etc)
  2. Added <Plug> for allowing mappings

Notes:
  1. There are many any types
  2. In DecodeMessage() there was a lambda function inside substitute() but I
     haven't understood what is for...
  3. In the original script there were a number of unlet and I don't know how
     to handle them in vim9
